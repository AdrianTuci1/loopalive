# LoopaLive: Intelligent DAWless Music Generator

## Key Features:

* **Node-Based Musical Generation (TensorFlow Powered):** Each visual node acts as an independent musical generator, powered by its own TensorFlow model. This enables simultaneous and parallel generation of complex musical patterns (e.g., drums, basslines, melodies).
* **Intuitive "Corner-Based" Interface:** Control pattern generation by adjusting "anchor points" (corners). Patterns closer to a corner will be more similar, allowing for fluid interpolation of musical ideas.
* **Dynamic Model Training Visualization:** Observe in real-time how the underlying AI models learn and refine their generative capabilities, offering insight into the AI's creative process.
* **Smart Recommendations:** Receive intelligent suggestions for new patterns, parameters, or node connections, based on your musical input and current creative context.
* **DAWless Compatibility:** Designed to interact seamlessly with external hardware musical equipment (synthesizers, drum machines, samplers) via MIDI or other relevant protocols.
